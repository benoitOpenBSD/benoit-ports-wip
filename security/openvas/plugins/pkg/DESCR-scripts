This is a set of NASL (Nessus Attack Scripting Language) scripts,
which can be used in performing network secrutiy scans.


WARNING

The nikto.nasl plugins expects nikto.pl to be in the search path
Workaround is to create a link between nikto and nikto.pl.

The scripts are separated they are not Arch dependant and the
openvas-nvt-sync will download the current scripts.

Many scripts require other packages which are not included in
the dependancies, Nikto, Nmap, ike-scan, Hydra, SLAD,
smnpwalk, ldapsearch (OpenLDAP), pnscan, portbunny,
strobe. For windows scans, smbclient from samba is used.
