This will removed the previous descriptions, it
is likely the openvas server will crash without do this.
The contents will be regenerated when openvasd is run.

this should be copied to /var/openvas. This may be modifed to include other
services

the openvas-nvt-sync script. The .nasl scripts are in a separate package

with out issues, after openvas-nvt-sync updates.
