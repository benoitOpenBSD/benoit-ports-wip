This is a pure python implementation of the DES encryption algorithm.
It's pure python to avoid portability issues, since most DES
implementations are programmed in C (for performance reasons).

The code below is not written for speed or performance, so not for those
needing a fast des implementation, but rather a handy portable solution
ideal for small usages.
