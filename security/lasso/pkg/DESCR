Lasso is a free software C library aiming to implement the Liberty Alliance
standards; it defines processes for federated identities, single sign-on and
related protocols. Lasso is built on top of libxml2, XMLSec and OpenSSL.

Lasso first focused on implementing the Liberty Alliance ID-FF 1.2
protocols. It now supports a good part of ID-WSF and SAML 2.0 support has
also been completed.
