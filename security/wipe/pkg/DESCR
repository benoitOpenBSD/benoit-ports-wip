"wipe" is a short, nice tool for securely wiping out files from magnetic
media.
Purpose: to quickly wipe out traces of your latest dissident activities
(cryptography etc.) when you realise that your local SSP (State Security
Police, aka. NSA, DST, CIA, MIT (Turkish Intelligence Agency), Mossad, ...)
is knocking at your door.
