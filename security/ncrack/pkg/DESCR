Ncrack is an open source tool for network authentication cracking.  It
was designed for high-speed parallel cracking using a dynamic engine
that can adapt to different network situations. Ncrack can also be
extensively fine-tuned for special cases, though the default
parameters are generic enough to cover almost every situation. It is
built on a modular architecture that allows for easy extension to
support additional protocols. Ncrack is designed for companies and
security professionals to audit large networks for default or weak
passwords in a rapid and reliable way. It can also be used to conduct
fairly sophisticated and intensive brute force attacks against
individual services.
