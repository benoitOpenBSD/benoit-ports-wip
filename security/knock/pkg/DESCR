This is a port-knocking server/client.  Port-knocking is a method where a
server can sniff one of its interfaces for a special "knock" sequence of
port-hits.  When detected, it will run a specified event bound to that port
knock sequence.  These port-hits need not be on open ports, since we use
libpcap to sniff the raw interface traffic.
