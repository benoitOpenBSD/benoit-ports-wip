The python mcrypt module provides an interface for the mcrypt library.

Mcrypt is a library which provides a uniform interface to several symmetric
encryption algorithms. It is intended to have a simple interface to access
encryption algorithms in ofb, cbc, cfb, ecb and stream modes. The algorithms
it supports are DES, 3DES, RIJNDAEL, Twofish, IDEA, GOST, CAST-256, ARCFOUR,
SERPENT, SAFER+, and more.
