md5deep is a set of programs to compute MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, Tiger, or
Whirlpool message digests on an arbitrary number of files. md5deep is
similar to the md5sum program found in the GNU Coreutils package, but
has the following additional features:

- Recursive operation - md5deep is able to recursive examine an entire
directory tree. That is, compute the MD5 for every file in a directory
and for every file in every subdirectory.  
- Comparison mode - md5deep can accept a list of known hashes and 
compare them to a set of input files. The program can display either 
those input files that match the list of known hashes or those that 
do not match. Hashes sets can be drawn from Encase, the National 
Software Reference Library, iLook Investigator, Hashkeeper, md5sum, 
BSD md5, and other generic hash generating programs. Users are welcome 
to add functionality to read other formats too!  
- Time estimation - md5deep can produce a time
estimate when it's processing very large files.  
- Piecewise hashing - Hash input files in arbitrary sized blocks 
- File type mode - md5deep can process only files of a certain type, 
such as regular files, block devices, etc.

hashdeep is a program to compute, match, and audit hashsets. With
traditional matching, programs report if an input file matched one in a
set of knows or if the input file did not match. It's hard to get a
complete sense of the state of the input files compared to the set of
knowns. It's possible to have matched files, missing files, files that
have moved in the set, and to find new files not in the set. Hashdeep
can report all of these conditions. It can even spot hash collisions,
when an input file matches a known file in one hash algorithm but not in
others. The results are displayed in an audit report.
