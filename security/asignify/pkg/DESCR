Asignify tool is heavily inspired by [signify](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/signify) used in OpenBSD.
However, the main goal of this project is to define high level API for signing files,
validating signatures and encrypting using public keys cryptography.
Asignify is designed to be portable and self-contained with zero external
dependencies. It uses [blake2b](https://blake2.net/) as the hash function
and ed25519 implementation from [tweetnacl](http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/).
