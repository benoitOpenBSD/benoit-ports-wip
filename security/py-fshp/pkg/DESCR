Fairly Secure Hashed Password (FSHP) is a salted, iteratively hashed
password hashing implementation.

Design principle is similar with PBKDF1 specification in RFC 2898 (a.k.a:
PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version 2.0)

FSHP allows choosing the salt length, number of iterations and the
underlying cryptographic hash function among SHA-1 and SHA-2 (256, 384,
512).
