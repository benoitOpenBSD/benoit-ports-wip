Python wrapper for bcrypt

Bcrypt is an implementation of a modern password hashing algorithm, based on
the Blowfish block cipher, by Niels Provos and David Mazieres. It has been
the default password scheme since OpenBSD 2.1.

A paper on the algorithm that explains its design decisions is available
here:
    http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos.html

The most important property of bcrypt is that it is adaptable to future
processor performance improvements, allowing you to arbitrarily increase the
processing cost of checking a password while still maintaining compatibility
with your older password hashes.
