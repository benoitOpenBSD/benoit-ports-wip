PySkein is an extension module for Python 3.0 or later, allowing Python
scripts to compute hash values with the recently proposed Skein hash
algorithm (one of the Second Round Candidates in the NIST SHA-3
Competition). It is based on the optimized version of the Skein reference
implementation, written in C by Doug Whiting.
