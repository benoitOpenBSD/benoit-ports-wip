arc4 random number generator

Very quick high quality 32-bit pseudo-random number generator.

This code is derived from section 17.1 of Applied Cryptography, second
edition, which describes a stream cipher allegedly compatible with RSA Labs
"RC4" cipher (the actual description of which is a trade secret).
