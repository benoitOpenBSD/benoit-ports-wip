WAFP is a Web Application Finger Printer written in ruby using a SQLite3
DB.

WAFP fetches the files given by the Finger Prints from a webserver and
checks if the checksums of those files are matching to the given checksums
from the Finger Prints. This way it is able to detect the detailed version 
and even the build number of a Web Application.
