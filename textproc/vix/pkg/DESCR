Vix is another graphical (SDL-based) hexadecimal dump tool designed for
GNU/Linux (alhtough it may compile in other Unices) with an important
feature: it lets you see the patterns formed by its bits. With some
practice, you can train your eyes to spot sections within an executable
file, a firmware, or any file made out of blocks of any content.
