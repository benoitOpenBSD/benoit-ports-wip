Dieharder is a random number generator (rng) testing suite. It is
intended to test generators, not files of possibly random numbers as the
latter is a fallacious view of what it means to be random. Is the number
7 random? If it is generated by a random process, it might be. If it is
made up to serve the purpose of some argument (like this one) it is not.
Perfect random number generators produce unlikely sequences of random
numbers -- at exactly the right average rate. Testing a rng is therefore
quite subtle.

dieharder is a tool designed to permit one to push a weak generator to
unambiguous failure (at the e.g. 0.0001% level), not leave one in the
limbo of 1% or 5% maybe-failure. It also contains many tests and is
extensible so that eventually it will contain many more tests than it
already does.
