PractRand (Practically Random) is a C++ library of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs, or just RNGs) and statistical tests for
RNGs.

Includes a variety of very high quality RNG algorithms.

Includes a standard battery of tests, in the tradition of Diehard.

Only a static library is provided (for higher performance).
