Pyglet
======

x11/py-pyglet is a soft dependency of SymPy. You should install it if you wish
to pretty print formulae or plot graphs.

Awesome WM
==========

x11/awesome seems to have a bug which is exposed by SymPy's plotting interface.
If you plot a graph, and dismiss it with the escape key, X will crash next time
you open a terminal.
