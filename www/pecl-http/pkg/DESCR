The HTTP extension aims to provide a convenient and powerful set
of functionality for major applications.

The HTTP extension eases handling of HTTP URLs, dates, redirects,
headers and messages in a HTTP context (both incoming and outgoing).
It also provides means for client negotiation of preferred language
and charset, as well as a convenient way to exchange arbitrary data
with caching and resuming capabilities.
