Eina works like a common portable music player. Just plays what you want to
listen.

Apart from simplicity, today users expect more from a player than just
reading files. Artwork, lyrics, network support, artist data and other music
information find their right place in Eina.

Plugins can take care of all the extra functionality, since Eina exposes
everything from its internals. It's fairly easy to extend the player
capabilities and change the way it works inside.
