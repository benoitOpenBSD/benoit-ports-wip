py-whisper is a fixed-size database, similar in design and purpose to
RRD (round-robin-database). It provides fast, reliable storage of
numeric data over time. Whisper allows for higher resolution (seconds
per point) of recent data to degrade into lower resolutions for
long-term retention of historical data.
