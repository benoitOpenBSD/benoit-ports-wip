ZDoom is, essentially, an advanced source port for Doom. However, it doesn't
just support Doom/Doom II... it also has support for Hexen, Heretic, and
Strife.

ZDoom's purpose is to allow Doom mappers to be more creative with their
work, using scripting. You can also add elements of detail to your levels,
such as slopes, mirrors, 3-D bridges (sort of), colored lighting,
deep-water, translucent glass, print messages, and many others.
