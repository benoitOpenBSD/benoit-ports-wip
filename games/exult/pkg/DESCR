As computers evolve, we risk losing classic games from the not-so-distant
past. One of these, Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge
following, and many consider it to be one of the most immersive games ever
produced. Exult is a project to recreate Ultima 7 for modern operating
systems, using the game's original plot, data, and graphics files.
