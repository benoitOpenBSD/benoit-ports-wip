DNSChef is a highly configurable DNS proxy for Penetration Testers and
Malware Analysts. A DNS proxy (aka "Fake DNS") is a tool used for
application network traffic analysis among other uses. For example, a DNS
proxy can be used to fake requests for "badguy.com" to point to a local
machine for termination or interception instead of a real host somewhere on
the Internet.
