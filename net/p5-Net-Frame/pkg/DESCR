Net::Frame is a fork of Net::Packet. The goal here was to greatly
simplify the use of the frame crafting framework. Net::Packet does
many things undercover, and it was difficult to document all the
thingies.

Also, Net::Packet may suffer from unease of use, because frames
were assembled using layers stored in L2, L3, L4 and L7 attributes.
Net::Frame removes all this, and is splitted in different modules,
for those who only want to use part of the framework, and not whole
framework.
