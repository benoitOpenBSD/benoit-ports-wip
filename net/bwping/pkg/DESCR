BWPing is a tool to measure bandwidth and response times between two 
hosts using Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request/echo 
reply mechanism. It does not require any special software on the remote 
host. The only requirement is the ability to respond on ICMP echo 
request messages.

Although BWPing does not require any special software on the remote host 
(only the ability to respond on ICMP echo request messages), there are 
some special requirements to network infrastructure, local and remote 
host performance:

* There should be no ICMP echo request/reply filtering on the 
  network; this includes QoS mechanisms (which often affects ICMP) at 
  any point in the testing path.
* Local host should have enough CPU resources to send ICMP echo 
  request messages with given rate, and remote host should quickly 
  respond on these messages and should have no ICMP bandwidth limiting 
  turned on.

If some of these requirements are not satisfied then the measurement 
results will be inadequate or fail completely. In general, for testing 
bandwidth where QoS is implemented, always test with traffic that 
matches the QoS class to be tested.
