Wireshark is used by network professionals around the world for
troubleshooting, analysis, software and protocol development, and
education. It has all of the standard features you would expect in a
protocol analyzer, and several features not seen in any other product.
Its open source license allows talented experts in the networking
community to add enhancements. It runs on all popular computing
platforms, including Unix, Linux, and Windows.

SAFETY NOTE:
The OpenBSD port of Ethereal (former name of Wireshark) was removed
from the tree due to security concerns.  While the initial Coverity
passes over the Wireshark tree found a number of bugs (now fixed),
Wireshark's development necessarily concentrates on new protocol
decodes, which leaves less time for code auditing.  It also compiles
with a fair number of type warnings.  Those concerns thus remain.

SECURITY MEASURES:
