DHCPStatus is a query tool for browsing information stored in DHCPD's
configuration and leases files, dhcpd.conf and dhcpd.leases. It
correlates the subnet details that you configure in the conf file
with the lease records that DHCPD maintains in its lease file. You
can thus obtain an overall picture of your DHCP environment, as
well as view details of individual leases for each IP.

DHCPStatus can be run either as a CGI script and viewed via a web
browser, or as a command-line tool that generates simple text output.
