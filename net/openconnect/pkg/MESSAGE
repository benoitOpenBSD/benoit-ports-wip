To connect to your server, running as root:

        openconnect --script /etc/openconnect/vpnc-script
        https://vpn.mycompany.com/

That should be it, if you have a password-based login. If you use
certificates, you'll need to tell OpenConnect where to find the
certificate with the -c option.
