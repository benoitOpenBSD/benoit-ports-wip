THe hping security tool is available in different versions and for different
systems. Hping2 is the old version of the tool supporting the command line
interfiace, while the new hping3 is the evolution that adds a Tcl scripting
engine. Note that hping3 even if used in command line mode (hping2
compatible mode) contains some fix, so if available for your system download
hping3 instead of hping2. If you plan to use hping in order to perform
automated networks scans and security tests you can use hping3 scripts
instead of hping2 + shell scripts, it is much more powerful!
