This is a Tektronix 4010, 4013, 4014 and 4015 terminal emulator for the 
Raspberry Pi and other Linux systems.

tek4010 can also display historical data for the MIT Project MAC 's 
ARDS (Advanced Remote Display Station).

There is a file "dodekagon.plt" in the repo, which you can use to 
test the tek4010 emulator. "dodekagon.plt" was produced in 2.11 BSD 
using my program "dodekagon". Type

./tek4010 -noexit cat dodekagon.plt

Or, for a ARDS display example, type

./tek4010 -noexit -ARDS cat ardsfiles/trek.pic

If you want to test an animation, type

./tek4010 cat animation.plt
