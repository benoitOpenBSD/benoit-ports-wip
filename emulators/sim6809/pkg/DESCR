This is version 0.1 beta of sim6809.

sim6809 is a 6809 simulator, which contains a debugger, and support for
Intel Hex binary files.

This program is beta software, and enhancements are welcome.
There is no documentation at this time. To see debugger commands, type "h"
in the debugger.
Have a look to the example 6809 file example.asm, which explains how to print
text on the console, and how to read a string from standard input.
