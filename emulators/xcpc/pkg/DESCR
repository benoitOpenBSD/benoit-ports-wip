Xcpc is a portable Amstrad CPC 464/664/6128 emulator written in C. 

It is designed to run on any POSIX compliant system having an X11 
server, including Linux, BSD and Unix.

Xcpc is designed to emulate classic range of the Amstrad CPC systems:

    Amstrad CPC 464 (v1).
    Amstrad CPC 664 (v2).
    Amstrad CPC 6128 (v3).

The Amstrad CPC+ range and the GX4000 console are not currently 
emulated and likely will not be.
