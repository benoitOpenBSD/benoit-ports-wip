OS9L1 is an OS9 level One emulator (for Motorola 6809) that runs under 32-bit UNIX/Linux. 
It is almost full-featured, and can emulate fork, signals, pipes etc. 
All without needing the OS9 kernel from Microware.

The emulator is built on Ray Bellis' Usim emulator, and also fixes some bugs in same.
