Mini vMac can emulate the Macintosh Plus.

Mini vMac requires a correct ROM for the Mac model to emulate, named
"vMac.ROM".  This can be in the current directory before executing the
"minivmac" command.

Mini vMac can boot an image file (such as an OS). This can be named
"disk1.dsk" and if placed in the current directory before executing
"minivmac" it will be loaded.

Mini vMac does not support sound emulation on OpenBSD.
