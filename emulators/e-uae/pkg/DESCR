This is a version of UAE, the Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator, with an emulation
core largely based on WinUAE. It attempts to bring many of the great
features of WinUAE to non-Windows platforms. This version now finally has a
name, E-UAE, since that's what everybody was calling it anyway. The 'E' can
stand for anything you fancy. Experimental, extreme, exciting, egalitarian,
eggplant, . . .
