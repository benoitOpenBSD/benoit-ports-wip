RunCPM is an application which can execute vintage CP/M 8 bits programs on 
many modern platforms, like Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, MS-DOS, 
Arduino DUE and variants, like the Teensy or ESP32. It can be built both 
on 32 and 64 bits host environments and should be easily portable to other 
platforms.
RunCPM is fully written in C and in a modular way, so porting to other 
platforms should be only a matter of writing an abstraction layer file for 
it. No modification to the main code modules should be necessary.

If you miss using powerful programs like Wordstar, dBaseII, mBasic and 
others, then RunCPM is for you. It is very stable and fun to use.
RunCPM emulates CP/M 2.2 from Digital Research as close as possible, the 
only difference being that it uses regular folders on the host instead of 
disk images.
