CP/Mish is an open source sort-of-CP/M distribution for the 8080 and 
Z80 architectures (although for technical reasons currently it only 
works on the Z80).

It contains no actual Digital Research code. Instead, it's a collection 
of third party modules which replicate it, all with proper open source 
licenses, integrated with a build system that should make it easy to work with.
