Configuration examples
======================

Sample configurations and decoders for various RF devices are available in: 
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/${PKGSTEM}

Tuning and Performance
======================

The default sample rate used by ${PKGSTEM} may be too high for some hardware or
environments, potentially preventing capturing any packets.

Testing has shown that a sample rate of 1024k is generally stable and sufficient
for most supported devices. You can specify this rate using the -s flag:

# ${PKGSTEM} -s 1024k
