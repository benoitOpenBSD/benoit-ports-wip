VOLK is the Vector-Optimized Library of Kernels. It is a library that 
contains kernels of hand-written SIMD code for different mathematical 
operations. Since each SIMD architecture can be very different and no 
compiler has yet come along to handle vectorization properly or highly 
efficiently, VOLK approaches the problem differently.
