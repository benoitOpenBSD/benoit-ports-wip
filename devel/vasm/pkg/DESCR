vasm is a portable and retargetable assembler to create linkable objects 
in various formats or absolute code. Multiple CPU-, syntax and output-modules 
can be selected.
Many common directives/pseudo-opcodes are supported (depending on the syntax 
module) as well as CPU-specific extensions.
The assembler supports optimizations (e.g. choosing the shortest possible 
branch instruction or addressing mode) and relaxations (e.g. converting a 
branch to an absolute jump when necessary).
Most syntax modules support macros, include directives, repetitions, 
conditional assembly and local symbols.
