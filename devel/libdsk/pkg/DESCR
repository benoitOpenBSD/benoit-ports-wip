LIBDSK is a library for accessing discs and disc image files. It is intended for
use in:

Emulator tools - converting between real floppy discs and disc images, as
  CPCTRANS / PCWTRANS do under DOS.
Filesystem utilities - CPMTOOLS is configurable to use LIBDSK, thus allowing the
  use of CPMTOOLS on emulator .DSK images.
Emulators - it is possible to use LIBDSK as part of an emulator's floppy
  controller emulation, thus giving the emulator transparent access to .DSK
  files or real discs.

LIBDSK has drivers for:

Raw files (including /dev/fdn).
Raw files, rearranged into logical filesystem order.
.DSK files, as used in CPCEMU, JOYCE and other Sinclair/Amstrad emulators.
MYZ80 hard drive image files.
NanoWasp floppy image files.
.CFI (Compressed Floppy Image) files, as created by FDCOPY.COM under DOS.
The Linux floppy drive (supports CPC System and Data formats, which the standard
  "Raw file" driver does not).
The Windows 3.x/95/98/ME/NT/2000 floppy drive.
The DOS floppy drive (via the PC BIOS).
CopyQM files
TeleDisk files
Compaq QRST files
APRIDISK image files
The LDBS format
rcpmfs - a backend that makes a Unix/Windows directory appear to be a CP/M disc
  image.
Another instance of LibDsk over a serial line.
