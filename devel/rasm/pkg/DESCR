Yes! Another Z80 assembler but this one has...

- DAMN fast assembling (millions of instructions in a blink of an eye)
- integrated crunched sections (LZ48/LZ49/LZ4/ZX7/Exomizer/APlib/LZSA1/LZSA2) 
  + load&crunch on the fly
- CPC cartridge, ZX snapshots, CPC snapshots up to 4M, TAPE output
- save unlimited binaries with or without AMSDOS/HOBETA header
- handle multiple EDSK update or generation simultaneously
- symbols import/export, breakpoint and dependencies export
- ORG checking, unlimited memory workspaces where labels are shared, 
  bank management, structures
- ALL undocumented instructions
- conditionnal macro, unlimited & embeded loops with local labels, switch/case
- floating point engine, mathematical functions, ...
- MAXAM, AS80, UZ80, Pasmo compatibility option
- Amsdos real & Microsoft basic 40bits float support
- English & French documentation

The project was born a few years ago (2017) because i needed a really fast 
assembler in order to finish my demo before the deadline of the Alchemy 2017. 
The project was quite huge with approx 350.000 words to assemble but 
thanks to rasm, the 512K cartridge compiled in a blink of an eye even 
on my slow Atom CPU. Now Rasm is the reference for huge projects and 
ultra-fast assembling.
