Based on Lennart Benschop's C core that can be found somewhere on the 'net 
(last address known to me was http://koti.mbnet.fi/~atjs/mc6809/Assembler/A09.c), 
I built a complete Macro Assembler that is functionally better than the 
TSC Flex9 Assembler (no wonder, I got multimegabytes to play with, 
whereas this excellent piece of software works within 50K or so!). 
It can deliver binary, Intel Hex, Motorola S1, and Flex9 binary 
output files, plus Flex9 RELASMB-compatible relocatable object modules.

I taylored the original to my taste by working through the source 
code; since A09 has reached a level of complexity that doesn't 
really lend itself to following the "Use the Source, Luke!" 
principle if you just want to hack a little 6809 assembly 
program, I've added this documentation. Have fun!
