This module can read, modify, create and write Perl XS typemap files. If
you don't know what a typemap is, please confer the perlxstut and perlxs
manuals.

The module is not entirely round-trip safe: For example it currently
simply strips all comments. The order of entries in the maps is,
however, preserved.
