Ripes is a graphical 5-stage processor pipeline simulator and assembly code
editor built for the RISC-V instruction set architecture, suitable for teaching
how assembly level code is executed on a classic pipelined architecture. Ripes
is especially suitable for illustrating how concepts such as forwarding and
stalling works, giving a visual representation of both cases.
