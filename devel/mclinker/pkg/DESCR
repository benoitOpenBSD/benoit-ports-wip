MCLinker is a full-fledged system linker for mobile devices. It supports
multiple platforms (ARM, X86 and Mips). It is fast, small with low
memory footprints. And the best, MCLinker is non-GPL open source.

MCLinker leverages the LLVM to link object files, and generate shared
objects and executable files. In our experiments, MCLinker is steadily
x2 faster than GNU ld. With debug info striping, MCLinker is also faster
than Google gold. MCLinker increases the code size of Android libbcc
only less than 180KB. Its code size is 1/8 of GNU ld and 1/15 of Google
gold linker.

So far, MCLinker is a full-fledged linker on Android Jelly Bean
platforms.  It can generate shared object for Android JNI (Java Native
Interface) environment. It supports various Android platforms. ARM, x86
and MIPS platforms are examined.
