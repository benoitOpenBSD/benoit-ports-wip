The Raspberry Pi Pico SDK (henceforth the SDK) provides the headers, libraries
and build system necessary to write programs for the RP2040-based devices such
as the Raspberry Pi Pico in C, C++ or assembly language.

The SDK is designed to provide an API and programming environment that is
familiar both to non-embedded C developers and embedded C developers alike. A
single program runs on the device at a time and starts with a conventional
main() method. Standard C/C++ libraries are supported along with C level
libraries/APIs for accessing all of the RP2040's hardware include PIO
(Programmable IO).

Additionally the SDK provides higher level libraries for dealing with timers,
synchronization, USB (TinyUSB) and multi-core programming along with various
utilities.

The SDK can be used to build anything from simple applications, to fully fledged
runtime environments such as MicroPython, to low level software such as RP2040's
on-chip bootrom itself.

Additional libraries/APIs that are not yet ready for inclusion in the SDK can be
found in pico-extras.
