z88dk is a z80 C cross compiler supplied with an assembler/linker and a set 
of libraries implementing the C standard library for a number of different 
z80 based machines. The name z88dk originates from the time when the project 
was founded and targetted only the Cambridge z88 portable.

The compiler featured in z88dk is a much enhanced Small C compiler; the 
compiler accepts many features of ANSI C and is only deficient in a few areas 
where implementation on a z80 processor might prove inefficient. The compiler 
performs simple optimisations, but the bulk of the optimisation is achieved 
by a set of peep-hole rules, which will typically reduce the size of a large 
project by up to a third.

The libraries supplied with z88dk are designed to be as generic as possible, 
indeed it is possible to port to a new machine simply by supplying two 
library routines and some startup code. It is hoped that one day z88dk will 
support as many z80 based machines as there is information available and 
sufficient interest in. Currently z88dk supports more than eighty z80 
family targets with the level of library support for each target varying 
with interest shown by users.
