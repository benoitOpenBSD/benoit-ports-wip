Based on Arto Salmi's C core that can be found somewhere on the 'net 
(last address known to me was http://koti.mbnet.fi/~atjs/mc6809/Disassembler/dasm09.TGZ), 
I built a complete 6800/6809/6309 disassembler that can handle input files 
in a variety of formats (Intel Hex / Motorola S09 / Flex9 Binary / Binary). 
Since disassembly without guidance produces measly results, it can load 
information files with quite a lot of directives, too.

I taylored the original to my taste by working through the source code; 
since F9DASM has reached a level of complexity that doesn't really lend 
itself to following the "Use the Source, Luke!" principle if you just 
want to disassemble a little 6809 program, I've added this documentation. 
Have fun!
