picotool is a tool for inspecting RP2040 binaries, and interacting 
with RP2040 devices when they are in BOOTSEL mode. (As of version 
1.1 of picotool it is also possible to interact with RP2040 devices 
that are not in BOOTSEL mode, but are using USB stdio support from 
the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK by using the -f argument of picotool).
