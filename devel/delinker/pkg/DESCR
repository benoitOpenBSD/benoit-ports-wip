This program does the opposite of a linker - it takes a fully linked binary 
executable file as input, and outputs a set of relocatable .o files. 
These .o files can be linked again to create a working binary executable. 
The set of .o files can also be modified before being relinked, either by 
simply replacing one more more .o files with alternate versions, or by 
more intrusive methods that modify the contents of the file.
