Merlin 32 is a multi-pass Cross Assembler running under Windows, Linux 
and Mac OS X targeting 8 bit processors in the 6502 series (such as 
6502 and 65c02) and the 16 bit 65c816 processor.

It is compatible with Glen Bredon's Merlin 16+ syntax, including support 
for Macros, Pre-processor,  Logical Expressions, Conditional Operations, 
Variables, Loops, Local Labels...

It can build fixed position object code or relocatable executables 
(OMF v2.1) as we can find on 16 bits Apple IIgs operating systems like 
Prodos 16 or GS/OS (S16, Exe, CDA, NDA, FST, PIF, Library, Tool...).

Merlin 32 is part of the Brutal Deluxe's Cross Development Tools Project, 
a full set of utilities available on Windows (and other) platforms to 
enable the creation of new Apple IIgs software : 65c816 Assembler, 
65c816 Disassembler, 65c816 Simulator, Graphic File Converter, Resource 
Catcher...
