The asmx cross assembler is a multi-CPU macro assembler written by Bruce 
Tomlin and available from his xi6.com Web site. The version I downloaded, 
is "asmx-2.0b5.zip" Version 2.0 beta 5, from 2009 I believe, which I 
downloaded early 2012. There's no specific terms of use or licence 
described on site. Bruce seems to support a lot of classic video-game 
project with hardware and software. There's other tools on his site 
which may be of interest.

The cross-assemble supports "macro" capability; that's a feature I 
wanted to make available for M/S card owners; in a cross-assembler 
with sources freely available. It supports many 8-bit microprocessors; 
my interest on this page is the RCA COSMAC 1802 and related support.
