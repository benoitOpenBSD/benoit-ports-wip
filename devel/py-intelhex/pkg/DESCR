The Intel HEX file format is widely used in microprocessors and 
microcontrollers area (embedded systems etc) as the de facto standard 
for representation of code to be programmed into microelectronic devices.

This work implements an intelhex Python library to read, write, create 
from scratch and manipulate data from Intel HEX file format.
