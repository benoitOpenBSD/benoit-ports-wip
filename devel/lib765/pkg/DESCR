Lib765 is the floppy controller emulation from JOYCE, separately packaged. 
It is (in some sense) the reverse of LibDsk; it converts uPD765a commands 
into LibDsk API calls. It should come in handy if you're writing a PCW, CPC 
or Spectrum+3 emulator; if you want to use it in a PC emulator, you'll need 
to add features such as DMA.
