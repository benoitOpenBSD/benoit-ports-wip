Qucs-S is a circuit simulation program based onQucs circuit simulator. 
The "S" letter indicates SPICE. The purpose of the Qucs-S project is 
to use free circuit simulation kernels (Ngspice, Qucsator, Xyce) with 
the unified GUI based on Qt6 toolkit. It merges the power of SPICE 
and the simplicity of the Qucs GUI. Qucs-S is not a simulator by 
itself, but it requires to use an external simulation backend with it.
