Remote MicroPython shell.

This is a simple shell which runs on the host and uses MicroPython's raw-REPL 
to send python snippets to the pyboard in order to get filesystem information, 
and to copy files to and from MicroPython's filesystem.

It also has the ability to invoke the regular REPL, so rshell can be used as 
a terminal emulator as well.
