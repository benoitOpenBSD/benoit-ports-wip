The SySS NAND Dump Tools are a collection of software tools for working 
with raw NAND flash memory dumps and images.

By using error-correcting codes, for instance BCH codes 
(Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem Codes), supporting different configurations, 
the NAND Dump Decoder can create error-corrected data dumps from raw NAND 
flash memory dumps, which can then be used with other tools, for instance 
the ubireader tools.

The NAND Dump Encoder can be used to create raw NAND flash memory images 
from binary input files for supported target platforms, which can then 
be directly written to corresponding NAND memory chips.

The NAND Dump Tools are based on and inspired by the open source software 
tool PMECC Reader and Decoder by Mickael Walter (@MickaelWalter).
