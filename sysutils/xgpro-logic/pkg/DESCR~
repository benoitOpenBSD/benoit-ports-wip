This is a little commandline utility that makes working with the XGecu Universal Programmer a little bit nicer.

The programmer has a useful "IC Test" function that allows one to run logic tests on a chip. However the user interface for working with that functionality is... not great.

It allows you to inspect .lgc files and convert them to/from toml format.

With the file in a toml format you can add your own logic vector descriptions much faster and then convert back into the .lgc format to import into the Xgpro tool.
