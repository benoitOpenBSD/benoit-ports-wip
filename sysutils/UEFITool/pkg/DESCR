UEFITool is a cross-platform C++/Qt program for parsing, extracting and 
modifying UEFI firmware images.
It supports parsing of full BIOS images starting with the flash descriptor 
or any binary files containing UEFI volumes.
Original development was started here at MDL forums as a cross-platform analog
to PhoenixTool's structure mode with some additional features, but the program's
engine was proven to be usefull for another projects like UEFIPatch, UBU and
OZMTool.
