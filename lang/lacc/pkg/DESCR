lacc is a compiler for C, written in C, which is able to compile itself.

Features:
* Complete support for C89, in addition to some features from later
  standards.
* Target x86_64 assembly GNU syntax (-S), binary ELF object files (-c),
  or pure preprocessing (-E).
* Rich intermediate representation, building a control flow graph (CFG)
  with basic blocks of three-address code for each function definition.
  This is the target for basic dataflow analysis and optimization.
