GHDL is an open-source analyzer, compiler, simulator and (experimental)
synthesizer for VHDL, a Hardware Description Language (HDL). GHDL is not
an interpreter: it allows you to analyse and elaborate sources for
generating machine code from your design.

Supports the 1987, 1993, 2002 versions of the IEEE 1076 VHDL standard,
with partial support for the 2008 and 2019 revisions and PSL.
