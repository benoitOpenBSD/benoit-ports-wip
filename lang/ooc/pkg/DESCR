ooc is an object-oriented programming language which is implemented with a
source-to-source translator to pure C99. It supports classes, abstract
functions, foreach, ranges, etc. It intends to be modern, modular,
extensible, yet simple and fast.

ooc is trying to reconcile high-level concepts from Java/C# and the speed
and small footprint of C. It somehow falls into the same category as Vala,
except that Vala is based on GLib, while ooc is based only on the standard C
library, making it very lightweight.

ooc is for people thriving for object orientation and other high level
features (e.g. a garbage collector, foreaches, imports vs includes), without
willing to bear the weight of C++ or the Java/C# runtime environments.
