Welcome to my "by the Bluebook" C++ implementation of the Smalltalk-80 
system that runs on OS X, Windows, and Linux! Since first reading about 
Smalltalk in the August 1981 issue of Byte magazine, I have always been 
intrigued by it. At that time all we had were slow 8-bit computers with 
4K of RAM barely running fast enough to do anything useful. I was stunned 
as I read through the article -- this was futuristic alien technology 
that was surely beyond my reach. In 1988, while attending the University 
of Washington, I was exposed to two memorable pieces of technology: 
The first was Steve Job's NeXTCube and the other was a Tektronix (4400?) 
workstation running Smalltalk-80. Both were, and still are, amazing. 
It was only fitting that I implemented this Smalltalk on a descendent 
of the NeXTCube -- a MacBook Pro laptop.
