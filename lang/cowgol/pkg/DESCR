Cowgol is an experimental, Ada-inspired language for very small systems
(6502, Z80, etc). It's different because it's intended to be self-hosted
on these devices: the end goal is to be able to rebuild the entire
compiler on an 8-bit micro, although we're not there yet.

Features:
* Properly type safe, modern language inspired by Ada
* The compiler is written in itself and is fully bootstrapped
* Table-driven, easy to port backend (the 80386 backend is 1.2kloc
  with no other compiler changes needed)
* Global analysis: dead code removal and static variable allocation,
  leading to small and efficient binaries

The following targets are supported:
* Z80 and 8080, on CP/M
* 6502 and 65c02, on the BBC Micro with Tube second processor
* 6502 interpreted bytecode, on the BBC Micro with Tube second
  processor
* 80386, on Linux
* Generic and terrible C

Simple emulators for CP/M and the BBC Micro are included.
