Pnut: A Self-Compiling C Transpiler Targeting Human-Readable POSIX Shell

Pnut compiles a reasonnably large subset of C99 to human-readable POSIX 
shell scripts. It can be used to generate portable shell scripts without 
having to write shell.

It's main uses are:

    As a transpiler to write portable shell scripts in C.
    As a way to bootstrap a compiler written in C with an executable 
    version that is still human readable
