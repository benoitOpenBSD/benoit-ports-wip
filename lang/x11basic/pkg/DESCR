X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics
capability that integrates features like shell scripting,
cgi-Programming and full graphical visualisation into the easy to
learn basic language on modern computers.

The structure of the language is similar to the ATARI-ST GFA-BASIC.
GFA-Basic programs should run with only few changes.
